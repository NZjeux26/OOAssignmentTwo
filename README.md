# OOAssignmentTwo
Assignment Two for my OO class at Massey Univeristy.
Project was to make a library book database/check in system reading books from a text file. Four classes were required and a somewhat complicated workfloow of instructions had to be followed.

I was pinged hard for lack of polymorphism but still got a B+ out of it. It certainly has room for imporvement, which naturally i workout after i had finished and handed it in. Ohwell.
